The entirety of the mid-top silhouette is dipped in red, including the rubber tooling and herringbone tread outsole. Contrasting hits of black are used throughout the shoe’s branding elements and sockliner. While the all-red finish presents a radical new look for the vintage silhouette, the performance benefits remain unchanged, highlighted by full-length Zoom Air that extends from heel to toe.",

The sneaker features the original White, Fire Red, Black, and Tech Grey colorway, with the speckled Cement Grey accents that give the sneaker its nickname. Released during the 2016 NBA All-Star weekend in Toronto, the sneaker was also retro’d in 1999 and 2012. The 1999 and 2016 retros are the only models that feature the ‘Nike Air’ branding on the heel, just like the 1989 OG sneakers.",

With two shoes coming together, a unique upper features a double Swoosh, double tongue, double heel counter, double eyestay and double laces. It’s set against a blue and red upper that mixes suede, leather and mesh while a sculpted midsole juts out past the heel, adding an extra element of crazy design lines on an already chaotic shoe. The classic waffle outsole brings everything together, while Nike and Sacai branding can be seen on the back heel and insole.",

        "Kanye West’s Yeezy Boost 350 V2 in Semi Frozen Yellow first hit stores in November 2017, with a restock that released on December 14, 2018. Dressed in adidas’ signature Primeknit upper, the lifestyle runner is finished in an energetic bright yellow hue, one that extends to the laces, heel tab, and Boost-infused ribbed rubber midsole. Zebra-like black stripes add another design dimension to the upper, along with a tonal side stripe emblazoned with ‘SPLY 350’ in reverse red print. A gum rubber outsole adds grippy traction to the eye-catching design.",
